# Instruction

- Your main objective is to design and build an interactive dashboard in Looker Studio that evaluates the performance of different delivery carriers.
- This should help stakeholders answer questions such as:
  - Which carriers are the most reliable?
  - How do shipping times compare between carriers?
  - Where do most delays or failed deliveries occur?
  - What are the trends in shipment volumes and delivery times over specific time periods?
